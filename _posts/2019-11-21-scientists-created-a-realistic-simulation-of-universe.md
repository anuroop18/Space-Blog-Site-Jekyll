*Being able to see a galaxy form over billions of years is cool!
Scientists have created a realistic simulation of Universe to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies.*

#### The IllustrisTNG Project : An Universe Simulation Suite
- Shed light on the physical processes that drive galaxy formation.
- Understanding the evolution of galaxies.
- Deepen our understanding of galaxy formation. 

TNG50 was a collaborative undertaking between scientists in Germany and the United States. Using a powerful supercomputer, scientists have created a state-of-the-art simulation of galactic formation. It took 16000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany and more than a year to complete the simulation. Simulation produced visual data and several insights.
  

Following is the clip of simulation shared by TNG50 team. Enjoy!

>Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,‚Äù researcher Dylan Nelson said in a press release.

In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.
