On Monday scientists unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan. The map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's spacecraft Cassini. Titan is the second biggest moon in our solar system, behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than Mercury.

## Atmosphere of Titan

The atmosphere of Titan is composed of nitrogen(94.2%), methane(5.65%) and hydrogen(0.099%). There are also other hydrocarbons such as ethane, diacetylene, propane and so many other gases. The
surface pressure is about 50% higher than Earth at 1.5 bars which is near the triple point of methane. That allows gaseous methane to be present in the atmosphere and liquid methane on the surface.

## Organic materials
 
 Recent studies shows that one of Titan's three largest seas **Ligeia Mare** consists pure methane and likely has a seabed covered by sludge of organic-rich material.

 It shows how different organic compounds make their way to the seas and lakes on Titan. Scientists believe that Nitrogen and Methane react to produce a wealth of organic molecules and the heaviest of these molecules fall to the surface. When they reach the sea, some become dissolved in the liquid methane, while the insoluble ones tend to sink to the sea floor like the above graphic illustrating.

## Potential for life

After doing numerous gravity measurements by Cassini's Spacecraft,Titan revealed that the moon is hiding an underground ocean of liquid water. Titan’s rivers, lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane might serve as a habitable environment on the moon’s surface, though any life there would likely be very different from Earth’s life. Titan may have a potential to harbor environments with conditions suitable for life.
