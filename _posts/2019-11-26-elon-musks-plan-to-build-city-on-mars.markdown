All these years of space age and we have only been to Moon! Yes we have send lots of mechanical probes to almost every planet in solar system and many other heavenly bodies, but when are we humans going to land and settle on other planets?

All this time we have been waiting that some government company will lead us to interplanatery life. After so much anticipation now has come the time when we are becoming capable of arriving to our neighbour new home worlds.
After Moon, Mars could be the first planet where humanity steps foot and builds their home.
As our closest most livable and buildable neighbor (Venus has an extremely hostile surface environment), Mars has exerted a robust fascination over centuries.

Some astrobiologists believe that four billion years past, the Martian surface was apparently quite livable and that includes rivers, lakes and even a deep oceans. May be life on our planet could have return here way back, aboard Mars rocks that blasted into space due to some robust impact.

There are some dreamers around the world who want to see us evolving into an intergalactic civilization, these people are setting up their own space company, they are building teams gathering resources and propelling the civilization to other planets.

#### Elon Musk : The plan to build city on Mars

Who does not know Elon Musk... I mean he is The tech leader of our time. Launching rockets, landing rocket, electric cars, renewable energy, AI and what not. He is doing everything. His Space Exploration company SpaceX's overarching goal is to take humans to Mars. He believes that he would live on Mars himself very soon. Inspired by SpaceX, lots of other companies both government and private are noy in a race to colonise the neighbour red planet. SpaceX however is doing the most notable work in building the transportation system that we'll use to travel in our Solar system. Once we arrive on Mars we will have to build large cities to support our survival. In following video Elon himself explains how he plans that future city of Mars.
